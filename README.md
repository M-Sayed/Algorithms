# Rubalgos - Ruby Algorithms
Implementing common algorithms and data structures in Ruby.

# Memories
I was using C++ and I used to write this kind of things with it.

# Purpose
This repo exists only for the sake of memories retrieval, that's what I used to have fun with when I was practicing for ACM ICPC competitions.

Now, as I have fun with Ruby too, I decided to increase that fun by holding these memories and writing these useful things again, but this time in Ruby.

# How it works
I only write these things only when I need it or when I've a spare time and instead of feeling bored, I go and write some Ruby code instead.
