# Algorithms
Implementing and practicing algorithms and data structures in Ruby and/or C++.

# Why in Ruby? Isn't C++ enough?
I used to program these funny stuff in C++, but currently I spend most of my day using Ruby, and I enjoy it a lot, so why not?

# Purpose
I spent more than a year away from competitive programming, and my brain got oxidised, so I need to brush it up again. :D

Writing these stuff with Ruby to increase the fun level to its maxima.

# How it works
I only write these things only when I need it or when I've a spare time and instead of feeling bored, I go and write some Ruby/C++ code instead.

# What else?
I used C++ only for competitive programming, I've never cared about writing clean code or well designed code in C++. I've never cared about OO in C++. So I think it's time for some good writings in C++, isn't it?

# Testing
For now I only write tests for ruby implementation, but I intend to write tests for C++ implementation as well.

## Ruby Tests
I use `Rspec` to write tests in Ruby, you can run specs/tests using the following command.

`rspec --pattern 'Ruby/**/specs/**/*.rb'`

## C++ Tests
Maybe later.
